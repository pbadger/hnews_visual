Hello there!

This project looked at Hacker News articles immediately following the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings, and allowed users to see various themes trending on HN. All the graphs use d3.js, and we used the pattern and mechanize python libraries to pull articles from the HN 'newest' page. We also used underscore.js, intro.js, jquery, and Bootstrap.
