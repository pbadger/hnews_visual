README

Our project actually requires Ruby on Rails to run. We didn't realize this wasn't allowed in project 2 until it was too late. Currently we are hoping to get our project up on Heroku so that anyone can just visit the website to look at it.

Our main html file is not the index.html in the root directory, instead our main html file is located /web_resources/hn_visual/app/views/graphs/index.html
